# Quant Journal

A personal learning journal documenting my journey into quantitative finance and the skills I'm building to land a quant internship.

## Purpose

This repo is where I practice, experiment, and document concepts that matter for quant roles—from stochastic processes and market microstructure to low-latency systems. Each project is a stepping stone toward understanding how quantitative finance works in practice.

## Projects

### [gbm-simulation](gbm-simulation/)
**Geometric Brownian Motion & Monte Carlo**

- Simulating stock price paths using the GBM model
- Monte Carlo methods for option pricing and risk
- NumPy + Matplotlib for numerical work and visualization

### [orderbook](orderbook/)
**Order Book Implementation (C++)**

- Basic order book structure with buy and sell sides
- Order types, price-time priority concepts
- Foundation for understanding market microstructure and exchange mechanics

## Skills I'm Building

- **Stochastic calculus** — GBM, diffusion processes, Itô's lemma
- **Numerical methods** — Monte Carlo, discretization
- **Market microstructure** — order books, matching engines
- **Systems programming** — C++ for performance-sensitive code
